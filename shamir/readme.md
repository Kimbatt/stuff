# Shamir's secret sharing scheme

https://kimbatt.github.io/stuff/shamir/

With this tool, you can split up a secret into shares. The secret can later be reconstructed from a given number of shares.

Note: this tool requires BigInt to be supported by your browser. See [the list of browsers that support it](https://caniuse.com/#feat=bigint).  
Warning: since there is no standard way of using this scheme, you'll probably need this tool to decode the shares later.
